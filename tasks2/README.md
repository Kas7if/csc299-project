# Tasks2 - Experimental Playground

**Purpose:** Quick experiments and feature testing before integrating into main `knowledgeflow` codebase.

## What This Is For

- Test new ideas quickly
- Experiment with libraries (Rich, AI APIs, etc.)
- Prototype UI improvements
- Try different approaches
- Break things without consequences!

## Current Experiments

### None yet - Add your experiments here!

## How to Use

1. Create experimental scripts here
2. Test freely
3. When something works well, integrate it into `knowledgeflow/`
4. Document learnings

## Guidelines

- No need for perfect code - this is for exploration
- Try new libraries
- Test AI integrations
- Experiment with UI/UX ideas
- Have fun!
