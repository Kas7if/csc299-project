PROMPT: what can i do for my vibe coding lab final project(Final Project Details)


This is actually a really exciting project — it gives you a lot of freedom to show creativity and technical skill. Let’s break it down and then brainstorm several doable but impressive ideas you could use for your VIBE Coding Lab Final Project.

🎯 Goal Recap

You need to build — in Python — a:

Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS)

Personal Task Manager

Terminal-based chat interface to interact with them

AI agents that use or manipulate that stored data

Your data must be stored in JSON, SQLite, or Neo4J.

🧠 Step 1: Choose a Direction (Your Project “Vibe”)

The spec is flexible, so you can pick a theme that makes it stand out.

Here are five possible directions (each with unique flavor):

1. Student Productivity Assistant ("StudyMate")

Concept: A smart assistant that manages your study materials and tasks.

Stores notes, summaries, and deadlines.

AI can auto-summarize notes or generate flashcards from your stored text.

Chat interface supports commands like:

> add note “Integration by parts formula”
> summarize all notes on calculus
> show tasks due this week
> generate quiz from ‘discrete math’ notes


Database: SQLite for tasks/notes
AI Agent Idea: Summarizer + quiz generator using OpenAI API or local LLM

🧩 Why good: Combines PKMS, task management, and real AI utility for students.

2. Life Command Center ("Orbit")

Concept: A minimalist “life OS” in your terminal — for managing habits, projects, goals, and notes.

Task manager supports priorities, tags, and deadlines.

Notes system supports linking between entries (like Obsidian).

Chat interface allows natural commands:

> add task “Finish gym plan” priority high
> show notes linked to ‘fitness’
> agent plan week


AI Agent Idea: “PlannerBot” that reorganizes or prioritizes tasks automatically.
Data: SQLite (structured tasks) + JSON (notes).

🧩 Why good: Elegant, clean, modern “terminal Notion” idea — professional-grade.

3. Developer Knowledge Base ("CodeCompanion")

Concept: Your personal dev assistant that stores code snippets, errors, and solutions.

Save snippets with tags (“python”, “git”, “SQL”).

AI agent can find similar snippets or explain a piece of code.

Terminal chat allows commands like:

> add snippet “git reset --hard” tag:git
> explain “list comprehension in python”
> find related snippets to ‘SQL joins’


Data: SQLite or JSON.
AI Agent: Explains or searches code intelligently.

🧩 Why good: Perfect for a CS student — demonstrates real-world developer productivity tooling.

4. Personal Reflection Journal ("MindVault")

Concept: PKMS as a self-growth and reflection tool.

Stores journal entries with mood, tags, and dates.

AI analyzes entries for patterns or emotions.

Chat supports:

> new entry “Felt productive today after gym”
> summarize my week
> what do I write most about?


Data: SQLite
AI Agent: Sentiment analysis or reflection summarizer.

🧩 Why good: Unique and emotionally intelligent — different from most coding projects.

5. Local Research Assistant ("ScholarSync")

Concept: Local database for research topics — stores PDFs, summaries, and notes.

AI summarizes papers or links related concepts.

Tasks track reading goals and deadlines.

Chat interface:

> add paper “AI and PKMS systems” file:ai.pdf
> summarize paper “ai.pdf”
> show notes linked to ‘AI agents’


Data: SQLite + local text/PDF processing.
AI Agent: Summarizer + keyword extractor.

🧩 Why good: Impressive integration of data and NLP — perfect for demonstrating AI utility.

⚙️ Step 2: Technical Components (Regardless of Idea)
Component	Description
Database	Use SQLite for structured storage (tasks, notes).
PKMS	CRUD for notes, linking, tags.
Task Manager	Tasks with due dates, priorities, completion flags.
Terminal UI	Use cmd, prompt_toolkit, or rich for a chat-like interface.
AI Agent	Use OpenAI API, Ollama (local), or simple rule-based logic.
Testing	Unit tests for CRUD ops and command parsing.
🧩 Step 3: Prototype Ideas

Start with small prototypes:

Prototype 1: Basic CRUD with SQLite

Prototype 2: Add CLI parser (chat commands → functions)

Prototype 3: Integrate AI (summarization, search, or automation)

Prototype 4: Polish UX + record demo

📽️ Step 4: Video Plan (for video.txt)

In your 6–8 minute video:

0:00–1:00 → Concept intro

1:00–3:00 → Architecture overview

3:00–6:00 → Live demo (add/edit notes, run agent, show outputs)

6:00–8:00 → Reflection: what you learned, challenges, next steps

🚀 Recommended Project (balanced option)

Project Title: “StudyMate — AI-Powered Personal Study Assistant”
Why: It fits the spec perfectly, is easy to scope, and can actually help you.
Stack:

Python 3

SQLite for storage

rich or prompt_toolkit for chat interface

openai or transformers for summarization

JSON for configuration/settings

Would you like me to:

Help you plan the architecture and file structure for one of these ideas (e.g., “StudyMate”)?
or

Help you pick which idea fits your strengths best (based on your coding comfort level)?
