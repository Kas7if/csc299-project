# Prototype 1: Basic KnowledgeFlow

## What This Prototype Explores

- ✅ SQLite database for persistent storage
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations for notes and tasks
- ✅ Simple terminal chat interface
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ No external dependencies (pure Python)

## How to Run

```bash
cd "prototype_1"
python main.py
```

## Features Implemented

### Notes
- Create notes with title, content, and tags
- List all notes
- View individual notes
- Search notes by content

### Tasks
- Create tasks with priority and due dates
- List tasks (sorted by priority)
- Mark tasks as complete

### Interface
- Simple command-line chat interface
- Persistent storage in SQLite

## What We Learned

This prototype helps us understand:
1. How SQLite works for our use case
2. Basic command parsing
3. Data structure needs
4. User interaction flow

## Next Steps

For the next prototype, we should explore:
- AI integration (OpenAI/Anthropic API)
- Better UI (using Rich library)
- Note linking functionality
- More sophisticated agents
